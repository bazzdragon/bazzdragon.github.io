        <h1>Adventures of Lobo</h1>
        <p>Adventures of Lobo is a 2D platformer game for pc. I made Adventures of Lobo alone using godot 4. I made the wolf Lobo using photoshop. Adventures of Lobo is a short game and i'd say it's pretty good for a first game. Your goal is to reach the flag in the end but there are coins to collect and 3 hidden green gems. Coins and gems are optional to collect and when you finish the game it tells you how many you collected.</p>
